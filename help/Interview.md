During the implementation of the test option, did you find the step by step user-manual
helpful and clear enough?

If not what parts were unclear?

During the implementation of the test option, Did you ever feel too limited within 
the toolbox we specified in the user-manual?

If so, what tools did you miss? e.g. signals, function primitives or others.

At first encounter, without knowing the embedded design of the option handler and
given the user-manual and an empty .c-file, did you feel like implementing the 
option was too complicated or just straight forward? 


The current option generating script simplifies option development some, but 
the developer still needs basic knowledge of C-programming to fully complete the
option. The next step in the automation of option development would be to fully 
generate the option algorithm with the script, in order to add a GUI which 
does not need programming skills of any sort. Do you think this is possible given 
the variety in complexity of the current options?

Our idea for this issue is to have the choice in either using an automatized option 
generating functionality for the simple options as well as a way to generate empty
files for the more advanced options so that they can be tailored in the correct
way. Does this appeal as a potential base if the script were to be developed further?  

Unfortunately we did not have enough time to creating a GUI for simple 
development of options. Although we did have this in mind as future work when 
designing the script for generating c-files for options. Is the set-up script 
designed in a way so that it can be used in future development of this high-level 
GUI used for implementing options?

Are there any details about the script you would want to change?

Does the prototype validate the vision of an external option handler well?

Do you see this prototype and the idea receiving further in-house development? 

Are there any other comments you would like to add about the result of the prototype?
